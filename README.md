# Universal Subtitle Program 
_A tool that benefits all._

## What does it do? ##

Hello! Our system aims to help address some of the challenges faced by neurodiverse individuals. Video content has become increasingly prevalent on online platforms. However, many individuals, particularly those with ASD or ADHD, struggle to engage with video content due to sensory sensitivities, attention difficulties, or social communication challenges.

## How? ##
We aim to bridge the gap by providing customisable subtitles for all types of video content. The system works to accurately interpret audio and generate subtitles on the user's device, aiming to support full comprehension of video content for individuals with diverse needs.

## Our Motivation ##
While some of our team have intrinsic motivations stemming from a neurodiverse background, we recognise the benefits such a system would have provided during university studies. 

Our goal is to create a universally accessible tool that benefits all users.
